# Hotels data merge
>
  In any hotels site like Kaligo.com operated by Ascenda, there's a lot of effort being made to present
  content in a clean & organised manner. Underneath the hood however, the data procurement process is
  complex and data is often mismatched & dirty. The task is to write a simplified version of our data
  procurement & merging proceess.
